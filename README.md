# Not Paradox Launcher

This app was designed to replace the Paradox Launcher recently added in Cities: Skylines.
It might or might not work with other games from Paradox.

If you have other games from Paradox Interactive installed, make a backup for the file "**launcherpath**", located in "C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Local\Paradox Interactive\" before starting this launcher.

# What's it for

The app was designed for Cities: Skylines (Steam) but it should work with all Paradox Interactive games that use their launcher (untested)  
The current version only works on Windows (at least Win 8) (no access to a Mac PC so it won't come anytime soon).  
Steam Overlay is working!

# Installation

- download the latest release from the **Releases** page
- Extract the files to a folder of your choosing
- Start the **launcher.exe** app once to set it up
- Start the game from Steam as usual

# Uninstall

- delete the extracted files
- delete the file **launcherpath** from "C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Local\Paradox Interactive\"
